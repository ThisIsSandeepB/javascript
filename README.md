# Javascript

##Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language :smile:

- Javascript is one of the three core technologies of web development (HTML, CSS and JS).
- Today, Javascript can be used in different places:

  - Client-side: Javascript was traditionally only used in the browser.
  - Server-side: Thanks to node.js, we can use javascript on the server as well.

- Javascript is what made modern web development possible:

  - Dynamic effects and interactivity.
  - Modern web applications that we can interact with.

**Frameworks/Libraries like React, Angular and Vue are 100% based on Javascript**
